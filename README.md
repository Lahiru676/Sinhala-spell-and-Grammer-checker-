## Overview
The Spell and Grammar Checker is a tool designed to analyze and correct text by identifying and addressing grammatical and spelling errors. It supports batch processing and is capable of handling multilingual text. This project is particularly useful for writers, students, and anyone who wants to improve the quality of their written content.

## Features
- **Grammar Correction**: Detects and corrects grammatical errors in text.
- **Spelling Correction**: Identifies and fixes misspelled words.
- **Batch Processing**: Processes multiple texts simultaneously.
- **Custom Training Data**: Supports loading of custom training data for specialized use cases.
- **Multilingual Support**: Can work with various languages.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **OpenAI API**: Powers the text analysis and corrections.
- **Google Colab**: For seamless execution and integration.
